# [Django Dynamic API](https://appseed.us/developer-tools/django-dynamic-api/)

This tool aims to provide a secure, `production-ready API via DRF` (Django REST Framework) using the developer's minimum amount of code. For newcomers, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a leading backend framework used to code from simple websites and API's to complex eCommerce solutions.
[DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (Django REST Framework) is the most popular library for developing secure API services.

## How It works

As mentioned above, the **Dynamic API** tool aims to enable a secured API service on top of any Django codebase with a minimum effort. Here are the steps:

- `Define a new model` in the project (an old one can be also used)
- `Execute the database migration` to create/update the associated tables
- `Update the configuration` to enable the Dynamic API over the model
- `Start the app`
- Access the `Dynamic API Service`

For instance, if the new model managed by the Dynamic API is called books, the associate API is exposed at `/api/books/`

| Status | Item | info | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| âœ… | New Models Definition in `apps/models` | - |
| âœ… | The app is saved in `apps/dyn_api` | - |
| âœ… | Models enabled in `core/settings.py` via `DYNAMIC_API` variable | - |
| âœ… | The project exposes automatically a CRUD API over the new model | - |
| âœ… | Path of the service: `/api/products/` | In case the new model is `Products` | 
| âœ… | The API is powered via DRF using best practices | - |
